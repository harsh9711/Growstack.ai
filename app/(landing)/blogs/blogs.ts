      "Why Many AI-Based SaaS Providers Fail to Live Up to Their Promises: A Tale of Hype and Hope",
    description:
      "In the IT world, especially with AI-based SaaS provider companies, it sometimes looks as if we were playing charades. You know the one: a great deal of shifting, much vociferation, and—at times—an inspired conjecture. However, when you penetrate this veil, chances are high that the technological prospect of the advanced solutions that particular firm is selling does not meet the expectation. So why do so many of these providers fail? Hold on tight because we’re going to ride the uncontrolled rollercoaster of AI and SaaS while learning why the shiny gold isn’t always good.",

      "Alright, picture this: The poker game you’re hosting is all going down without the small stakes feel. You have the chips, you’ve laid the strategy, you are determined, but who is your partner for the project? The one pretending to be intelligent, or, the one who is intelligent enough to bluff at that moment? Selecting friends to, or choosing opponents on who to outwit can be vital in determining who wins or loses. Similarly, deciding on the right AI partner that will aid your business’s revenue expansion is also a question of strategy, trust, and some measure of risk. Screw it up and you are looking at yourself at a heap of losses. Do it right, and you are counting your Piggy Bank!",
